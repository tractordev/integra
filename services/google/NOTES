there *are* openapi schemas for google apis in APIs-guru directory,
BUT google's schema is closer to our internal schema and is easier to work with.

====

"insert" operations should maybe be normalized to "create"?

====

should Colors "get" become "list" or should the Item URL be the Collection URL?

% integra describe google-calendar.color  
=== RESOURCE INFO
Title:       Colors
Item URL:    https://www.googleapis.com/calendar/v3/colors

=== RESOURCE OPERATIONS
get    Returns the color definitions for calendars and events


====

in calendar, "calendarList" is converted to "calendarlist" .. maybe this is fine

===

from calendar's CalendarList schema (more of a response type than output)

"nextPageToken": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "Token used to access the next page of this result. Omitted if no further results are available, in which case nextSyncToken is provided."
          },

media.download just has metadata, so downloading a file must be extra?
this data seems to mark operations where this is the case

"supportsMediaDownload": true,
"useMediaDownloadService": true,

Google Calendar

acl, event, calendar resources all depend on calendarlist.list for calendarId.
they should be sub-resources. calendar has no list, but uses id from calendarlist.list
